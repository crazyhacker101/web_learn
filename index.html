    <h1>Project BlueBone Story</h1>

    <p><strong>Bluebone</strong> is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly
        magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding
        to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We
        believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical
        sophistication, probably
        more.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        Project BlueBone is an outgrowth of <a href="https://preptalk.in/"><em>Preptalk Pvt. Ltd.</em></a>. It is a
        consistent efforts of our founders in providing free education to the world to make it well equipped with the
        <strong><a href="#">technology of tomorrow</a></strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <p>
        Bluebone was founded by <strong>Saurabh Kumar</strong> and <strong>Riz Patel</strong> in 2020. We believe that
        the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the <em><strong>Bluebone tutorials</em></strong> can benefit at least a billion people,
        and
        probably more. To know more about us, <a href="#">click here</a>.
